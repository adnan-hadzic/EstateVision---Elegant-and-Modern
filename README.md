EstateVision – Elegant & Modern

EstateVision is a student project created for the Web Programming course at International Burch University.
It represents a modern, responsive Single Page Application (SPA) built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, serving as the frontend of a real-estate platform.

Milestone 1 – Static Frontend

-Project folder structure (frontend + backend directories)
-Fully functional SPA navigation (SPApp hash-based routing)
-Implemented static pages: Home, Listings, About, Dashboard, Profile, Login, Register, Property Details
-Consistent, modern and responsive design (EstateVision – Elegant & Modern theme)

Upcoming Milestones

-In the next stages of the project, EstateVision will be extended with a complete backend implementation using FlightPHP and MySQL.
-Milestone 3 will focus on completing full CRUD operations for all entities, introducing service logic and OpenAPI documentation.
-Milestone 4 will add authentication, authorization, and middleware, connecting the backend with the SPA frontend and enabling role-based access for users and admins.
-Finally, Milestone 5 will cover deployment, frontend–backend integration, form validations, and hosting the final live version of the application with complete documentation and CI/CD setup.
